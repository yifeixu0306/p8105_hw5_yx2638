### Problem 2

First, we read the data from the GitHub repository.

``` r
data_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv"

homicide = read_csv(url(data_url)) 
```

The raw dataset collects data on homicides in 50 large U.S. cities. It
has 52179 observations of homicides and 12 key variables represent uid,
reported date, victimsâ€™ last name, first name, race, age, sex, city,
state, latitude, longitude, and disposition.

Next, we create a city_state variable and summarize within cities to
obtain the total number of homicides and the number of unsolved
homicides.

``` r
homicide_tidy = homicide %>%
  mutate(city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "))
```
