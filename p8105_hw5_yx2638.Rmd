```


### Problem 2

First, we read the data from the GitHub repository. 
```{r, message=FALSE}
data_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv"

homicide = read_csv(url(data_url)) 
```
The raw dataset collects data on homicides in 50 large U.S. cities. It has `r nrow(homicide)` observations of homicides and `r ncol(homicide)` key variables represent uid, reported date, victims' last name, first name, race, age, sex, city, state, latitude, longitude, and disposition.


Next, we create a city_state variable and summarize within cities to obtain the total number of homicides and the number of unsolved homicides.
```{r}
homicide_tidy = homicide %>%
  mutate(city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "))
  
```
